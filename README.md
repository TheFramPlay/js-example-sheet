# js-example-sheet

This is just an example sheet to use through the fundamentals of JS. {essentially a blank HTML file that we'll run scripts in the browser.}
Read through the first section of JS fundamentals. I think this is going to be just a good refresher, to get to the intermediate stuff. :D

7/27/2022: Not really many changes, this sheet is still mainly being used to run JS examples.

Mostly everything in the .js file are notes that I've been taking.
